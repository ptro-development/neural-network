If you start from very optimised LA or LB you are going to end in some local
minimum which might give better result than UA or UB but it will likely make
next training for UA and UB very jittery.

LB is sometime better than LA because it easier to find local minimum from
better optimalized UA or UB.

!!! Check for starting strategy, you are still running with old solution util
you add a new layer.

There was second drop in URB training, interesting ?
